Because OSGi and Maven have differing rules about which version is "larger" when using a qualifier (such as 
SNAPSHOT) for performing development builds, the Security Testing project is going to take the following
version convention:  

- Development builds will use -SNAPSHOT for Maven-related artifacts and X.X.X.qualifier for OSGi artifacts.
- Release builds will replace -SNAPSHOT with .RELEASE and X.X.X (no qualifier) for OSGi artifacts.

The following configuration items need to be updated with the correct version information when switching 
from development to release build versioning:

All Eclipse Projects
- pom.xml -> <version> tag (can exist in multiple places if version differs from parent)

Eclipse Plugin Projects
- MANIFEST.MF -> Bundle-Version tag

Eclipse Feature Projects
- feature.xml -> version tag (can exist in multiple places)

Eclipse Update Site Projects
- category.xml -> url tag (can exist in multiple places)
               -> version tag (can exist in multiple places)
- site.xml -> url tag (can exist in multiple places)
           -> version tag (can exist in multiple places)
